# This is a template file for a DFA scheme, if you wanna add a comment use [#]
# First of all you have to write DFA states (set Q) all in the first avaiable line, so:
q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6,q7,q8
# are states for this DFA.
# Now you have to set the start state:
q1
# Ok, what are final/apc states?
q1,q3,q4,q5
# Write down here your alphabet as [symbol_1],[symbol_2],... Don't use spaces!
a,b
# In the following lines you can define the transitions, use the template [start_state],[symbol],[final_state]
# you can call states as you want but be careful with spaces. States are coded with strings and symbol with chars
q1,a,q2
q1,b,q5
q2,a,q3
q2,b,q6
q3,a,q4
q3,b,q3
q4,a,q4
q4,b,q3
q5,a,q6
q5,b,q1
q6,a,q5
q6,b,q2
q7,a,q8
