# DFAMinimazer
A school project for a minimizator for DFA based on Myhill-Nerode theorem

Many thanks to Johanna Hogberg and Lars Larsson from Umea University, this project is entirely based on their paper:

Feel free to modify my work, the code isn't the best but... ehy, it works.

Some commit you could follow:
- The comparators writed for the set objects are not goods, especially in the set<Partition> one. 
It was writed just because it was necessary, but - as you can see in the source - it's not used for directly compare objects.
